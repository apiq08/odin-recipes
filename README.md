The current project involves completing the HTML section of The Odin Project, a comprehensive curriculum designed to teach full-stack development. In this part of the course, I have focused on mastering the fundamental building blocks of web developmentâ€”HTML (HyperText Markup Language). This project includes creating structured, well-formed webpages, understanding semantic HTML elements, and ensuring proper use of HTML5 standards.

Skills Demonstrated
Upon completing the HTML portion of The Odin Project, I have demonstrated the following skills:

HTML Syntax: Proficiency in writing clean, semantic, and well-structured HTML code.
Page Layouts: Designing and structuring webpages with proper use of elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, forms, tables, and links.
Accessibility: Understanding the importance of accessible HTML, including the use of appropriate tags and attributes to improve user experience.
Responsive Design Fundamentals: Applying basic responsive design principles by structuring content for various screen sizes and ensuring proper rendering across devices.
Project Organization: Following a structured development approach, from prototyping to finalizing the HTML structure for a fully functional webpage.
Completing this section has provided a strong foundation in web development, particularly in building user-friendly, accessible webpages using HTML. I am now prepared to move forward into more advanced topics like CSS and JavaScript.
